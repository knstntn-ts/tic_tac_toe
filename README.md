# Tic Tac Toe
Console-based game of Tic Tac Toe.

Implemented using Python and played by entering coordinates by hand to the console window.

## Getting started
To get started all you need to do is to download and run main.py. All of the action is in the console of your IDE!

## Issues
Feel free to roast this work ;) I will adjust it to your needs.
